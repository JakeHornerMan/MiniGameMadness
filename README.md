# Deadlifting Minigame
I created a mini-game, with brain cloud integrations in and around 15 hours development time. 

The game has an anonymous authentication, email authentication, and username setting.
The game has fully functional all-time and daily high score leaderboards.
The game is a button masher that gets proceedly difficult each round.
Some gameplay elements are dependent on global entitys such as gravity and binus score multiplier.
Here we can see the leaderboards have been updated with our latest entry.
I have 2 custom scripts, one is to post scores to both leaderboards when the game is complete and another pulls multiple leaderboards by name in one call.
