# Deadlifting Minigame

I created a mini-game, with brain cloud integrations in around 15 hours of development time. It is a button mashing game that is based on weight lifting that gets progressively difficult each round.

## Features
* Anonymous authentication, email authentication, and username setting.
* Fully functional all-time and daily high-score leaderboards.
* Gameplay elements are dependent on global entities such as gravity and bonus score multiplier.
* Custom script that handle multiples gathering of leaderboard in 1 call.
* Custom script handling multiple posting to multiple leaderboards.

## How to use:
You can build the project in unity, of download the build attached to this google drive file.

## Demo:
* You will be anonymously authenticated when starting the game.
* You can set an email and password on your account with the sign-in button.
* You can also sign into another already created account with the sign-in button.
* You can check the leaderboard status on the Main Menu and on the Result screen.
* When in-game you will see the modifier on the left side these are affecting the gameplay.

## What I found easy:
The more I used the brain cloud platform the more I liked the service and API structure. It seem very open to using the endpoint created to make you own custom flows and functionality.
